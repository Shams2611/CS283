4. What I want to get out of this class:
I want to learn the basics of computer science really well. As I have worked for my internship and co-op I realized even though I have a good grasp in web development I lack a lot in the fundamentals. I aim to understand the concepts so well that I wish to be able to explain the concepts to someone else who is completely new to the field. 

5. Potential concerns about being successful in this class:
Often I struggle to write code in C. I have to put more time and effort into learning C.
